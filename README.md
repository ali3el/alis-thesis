# Thesis Project â€” Local Version

This folder contains the local version of my thesis project, originally developed and iterated on the **Quest** platform. All files have been brought over and preserved here for continued work, refinement, or backup on my local Mac.

The structure remains consistent with the original Quest organization, with multiple modeling attempts, data folders by year, and centralized comparison and visualization directories.

---

## Folder Descriptions

- `attempt_1/` to `attempt_5/`: Each folder contains a separate modeling attempt, including scripts for data prep, model training, evaluation, and saved outputs. These reflect iterative refinements across different stages of the project.
- `data19/` to `data23/`: Raw or preprocessed datasets grouped by year. These were the basis for the combined datasets used in modeling.
- `data_combined/`: A merged dataset created by combining data across years. Used as input for final model training and analysis.
- `master_comparison/`: Final comparative results and evaluations across models and attempts.
- `model_explainability/`: Tools and outputs related to interpreting and explaining model behavior (e.g., variable importance, SHAP values).
- `visualizations/`: All saved plots and figures used during exploration and reporting.

## Key Files

- `Project.Rproj`: RStudio project file for easy navigation in this local environment.
- `thesis.qmd`: Quarto file for compiling the final report or paper.
- `thesis.html`: Rendered output from the Quarto report.
- `thesis.pdf`: Final compiled PDF version of the thesis, incorporating LaTeX formatting.
- `apa.csl`: Citation style file (APA 7th Edition), used for consistent reference formatting.
- `references.bib`: BibTeX bibliography file containing all citation entries.
- `preamble.tex`: LaTeX preamble file, configuring document settings for PDF output.
- `title-page.tex`: LaTeX file containing the customized title page for the thesis.
- `preamle.tex.save`: Auto-save backup of preamble.tex (minor file, not actively used).

## Notes

- This is the **local copy** of the project and is not actively connected to Quest. All code and results reflect the final state of work done in Quest before migration.
- Folder-level `README.md` files within each modeling attempt provide more detail about scripts, recipes, and results in that attempt.
