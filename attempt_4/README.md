# Attempt 4 â€” README

This folder documents **Attempt 4** of the modeling process for my thesis project. Originally created in Quest, this version now runs locally on my Mac for continued analysis and model evaluation.

This folder contains scripts for data splitting, recipe preparation, model fitting, and performance comparison. It also includes saved recipe objects and model results in their respective subfolders.

---

## R Scripts

- `1d_data_split.R`: Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
- `2d_recipe.R`: Creates preprocessing pipelines for this attempt, saved for use in modeling.
- `3d_decision_tree.R`: Trains a decision tree classifier.
- `3d_knn.R`: Trains a k-nearest neighbors classifier.
- `3d_log_reg.R`: Fits a logistic regression model.
- `3d_naive_bayes.R`: Trains a naive Bayes model.
- `3d_rulefit.R`: Trains a RuleFit model.
- `4d_model_analysis.R`: Compares model performance and stores summary outputs.
